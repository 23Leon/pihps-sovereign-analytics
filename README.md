🌍 PIHPS Sovereign Macro Risk Intelligence Platform

🧠 Machine Learning–Driven Macro Risk & Inflation Monitoring Engine
Built using Indonesian strategic food price data (PIHPS – Bank Indonesia)

📖 Overview

This project is a Sovereign-Level Macro Risk Intelligence System designed to monitor, forecast, and analyze regional food price dynamics across Indonesia.

It transforms granular regional price data into:

📊 Regional risk indicators

📈 Inflation projections

🔥 National systemic risk signals

🚨 Early warning alerts

The platform simulates how a central bank or policy institution monitors macroeconomic stability using applied data science and machine learning.

🎯 Project Objectives

Implement a scalable Python-based data analytics pipeline

Build regional ML forecasting models (Province & District level)

Develop a forward-looking Early Warning System

Construct a Sovereign Macro Risk Index

Deliver interactive intelligence dashboards using Streamlit
