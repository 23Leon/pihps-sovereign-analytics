# 🌍 PIHPS Sovereign Macro Risk Intelligence Platform

> 🧠 Machine Learning–Driven Macro Risk & Inflation Monitoring Engine  
> Powered by Indonesian Strategic Food Price Data (PIHPS – Bank Indonesia)

---

## 📖 Overview

This project is a **Sovereign-Level Macro Risk Intelligence System** designed to monitor, forecast, and analyze regional food price dynamics across Indonesia.

The platform transforms granular regional price data into actionable macroeconomic intelligence, including:

- 📊 Regional Risk Indicators  
- 📈 Inflation Projections  
- 🔥 National Systemic Risk Signals  
- 🚨 Early Warning Alerts  

It simulates how a central bank or policy institution monitors macroeconomic stability using applied data science, machine learning, and macro aggregation techniques.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Develop a scalable Python-based data analytics pipeline  
- Build regional ML forecasting models (Province & District level)  
- Implement a forward-looking Early Warning System  
- Construct a Sovereign Macro Risk Index  
- Deliver interactive macro intelligence dashboards using Streamlit

# 🧠 Core Intelligence Features

---

## 1️⃣ Regional Forecast Engine

Machine learning–based forecasting per region:

### 🔹 Ensemble Model
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest  

### 🔹 Forecasting Capability
- 7-Day forward price projection  
- Province-level modeling  
- Kabupaten/Kota-level modeling  

### 🔹 Model Evaluation
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)  

📌 **Purpose:** Detect localized price pressure before it escalates into systemic risk.

---

## 2️⃣ Regional Risk Classification

Each region is dynamically classified based on:

- Forecasted price change  
- Historical volatility  
- Momentum pressure  

### Risk Levels:
- 🔴 **HIGH RISK**  
- 🟠 **MEDIUM RISK**  
- 🟢 **LOW RISK**  

📌 **Purpose:** Identify vulnerable regions in near real-time.

---

## 3️⃣ National Risk Ranking

- Automated scanning across all regions  
- Ranking by projected inflation pressure  
- Top 10 high-risk regions dashboard  

📌 **Purpose:** Highlight geographic concentration of macro stress.

---

## 4️⃣ National Macro Risk Engine

Computes sovereign-level macro pressure indicators:

- 📊 National Volatility Index  
- 🔁 Contagion Effect Index  
- 📈 Multi-Commodity Pressure Index  
- 🧮 Composite Sovereign Macro Risk Score  

📌 **Purpose:** Translate regional instability into measurable national systemic risk.

---

## 5️⃣ 30-Day National Inflation Projection

- Aggregated national price modeling  
- 30-day forward inflation projection  
- Inflation pressure signal detection  

📌 **Purpose:** Provide forward-looking macroeconomic outlook.

# 🏛 Data Source

**Pusat Informasi Harga Pangan Strategis Nasional (PIHPS)**  
Bank Indonesia  

### Dataset Coverage:

- 📅 Daily price data  
- 🌍 Province-level aggregation  
- 🏙 Kabupaten/Kota-level detail  
- 🛒 Multi-commodity coverage  

---

# 💡 Why This Matters

Food price instability is a leading indicator of:

- Inflation acceleration  
- Supply chain disruption  
- Regional economic stress  
- Systemic macro instability  

This platform demonstrates how applied machine learning and macro aggregation techniques can simulate sovereign-level economic monitoring systems.
